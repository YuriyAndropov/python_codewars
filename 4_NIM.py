#Description:
#This kata explores writing an AI for a two player, turn based game called NIM.
#The Board
#The board starts out with several piles of straw. Each pile has a random number of straws.
#Pile 0: ||||
#Pile 1: ||
#Pile 2: |||||
#Pile 3: |
#Pile 4: ||||||
#...or more concisely: [4,2,5,1,6]
#The Rules
#The players take turns picking a pile, and removing any number of straws from the pile they pick
#A player must pick at least one straw
#If a player picks the last straw, she wins!
#The Task
#In this kata, you have to write an AI to play the straw picking game.
#You have to encode an AI in a function choose_move (or chooseMove, or choose-move) that takes a board, represented as a list of positive integers, and returns
#(pile_index, number_of_straws)
#Which refers to an index of a pile on the board, and some none-zero number of straws to draw from that pile.
#The test suite is written so that your AI is expected to play 50 games and win every game it plays.
